# The Final Frontier

This project should have everything you need to play the Final Frontier.  It's an interplanetary rock, paper, scissors, Picard, Borg battle!

I went down a couple rabbit holes (React route transition animation and integrating Flow with VS Code- neither of which I got to work), but it was a fun project.  With more time, I would add a whole lot of tests and try to utilize the powers of sass a bit better.
